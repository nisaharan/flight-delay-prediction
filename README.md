Title: Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the time of delay for each flight. The main objective is to assist travelers, airlines, and travel companies in managing their schedules more efficiently by providing accurate predictions of flight delays.

The project is implemented as a GitHub repository, allowing for easy collaboration, version control, and accessibility.

Key Features:

Data Collection: Gathered historical flight data from reliable sources containing information such as departure/arrival times, weather conditions, airline performance, and other relevant features.

Data Preprocessing: Performed extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Conducted feature engineering to extract meaningful information and create new features that capture flight patterns and potential delay indicators.

Model Selection: Explored and experimented with various machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, and Neural Networks. Evaluated and compared their performances to select the most accurate and robust model.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the selected model using the training data. Employed techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure its predictive accuracy.
